      compound_smiles_sample.csv)
  - Researched PyTorch Geometric for molecular property prediction, performed
    baseline analysis, and prepared the graph neural network implementation for
    the OPV transparency prediction task. This involved:
    - Researching graph neural network architectures for molecular property
      prediction and understanding GCN layers, message passing, and molecular
      graph representations (see pyg_tutorial_complete.py)

    - Skeleton code and an executable test script to benchmark Hugging Face GNN models (e.g., Graphormer)(`hf_gnn_test.py`).
  - Researched modern GNN architectures, self-supervised molecular representation learning, cross-attention donor–acceptor fusion models, and transformer-based molecular generation pipelines. This involved:

    - Reviewing ~15 papers on GNN pretraining, spectral/electronic descriptors, and transformer+RL molecular design, focusing on how these techniques apply to OPV PCE and transparency.
    - Writing a 4-page IEEE-style literature review analyzing strengths, limitations, and methodological implications of current OPV ML pipelines (see `litReview.tex`).

    - Extracting actionable recommendations for transparency optimization, including:

      - integrating spectral/optical property pretraining targets,
      - adopting geometry-aware GNNs,
      - multi-objective prediction of PCE and AVT,

    - Writing skeleton code to load, configure, and run Graphormer-style models from Hugging Face using PyTorch (`hf_gnn_test.py`).

  - Established technical leadership by architecting the overall ML workflow, defining model selection strategies (PCE prediction → VGAE material generation), and creating comprehensive system design documents for team alignment.
  - Designed and implemented modular data preprocessing pipelines and model training infrastructure, enabling scalable experimentation and reducing friction for downstream team members.
  - Developed foundational skeleton code for key components (GNN benchmarking, data processing utilities) to accelerate team development and establish coding standards.
  - Conducted literature synthesis and technical feasibility studies, synthesizing findings into reports and architecture diagrams that guided critical decisions on graph neural network approaches and dataset enrichment strategies.
  - Executed advanced data engineering tasks including patent data scraping from Lens.org and other sources to augment the OPV2D dataset with industry-relevant molecular compounds and research trends.
